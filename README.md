<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

# Project Description
In this project , Rodrigo Franco and Gunnar David have done an in-depth analysis and visualization on the UCI air quality dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/air+quality) .The goal is to find the patterns and relationships in the dataset.

**In this notebook, you'll find:**
- Intro to the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Summary of extracted patterns and relationships within the datset

**Dependencies:**
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Pandas

The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo.


# Demo-Preview
<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Table of contents

After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

- Loading and understanding the dataset
- Cleaning the dataset
- Performing EDA on the dataset
- Finding co-realtion between different gases
- Finding concentration of pollutants
- Extracting features of air depending upon the level of CO concentration
- Realtion between relative humidity/ absolute humidity and temerature and it's concentration.
- Varition of temperature over two years.

**About the dataset**
The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year)representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons,Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer.

**Summary of the findings:**

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:

```git init```

```git clone https://github.com/Gunnar-D2810/UCI-Air-Quality-Analysis-Prediction.git```

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project can be used with contemporary data on the air pollution in Beijing in China for exploratory descriptive purposes or as tool for predictions with the trained regression & deep neural network models.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration.

# Contribute
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is where you can let people know how they can **contribute** to your project. Some of the ways are given below.

Also this shows how you can add subsections within a section.

# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Adding the license to README is a good practice so that people can easily refer to it.

Make sure you have added a LICENSE file in your project folder. **Shortcut:** Click add new file in your root of your repo in GitHub --> Set file name to LICENSE --> GitHub shows LICENSE templates ---> Choose the one that best suits your project!

I personally add the name of the license and provide a link to it like below.

[GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke).

So that is it... You have completed your training young grasshopper. Now it is time for you to use this ideas for your projects.

Don't forget your **README Sensei**(*cool twitter handle idea*) when your project takes off with your **Awesome README**.

Leave a star in GitHub, give a clap in Medium and share this guide if you found this helpful.

**Now folks, the moment you've all been waiting for! The footer!**
